# C++ Modules - Mastering Object-Oriented Programming

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete C++ curriculum from the C++ Modules project, divided into 10 sub-modules. Each module introduces progressively more advanced features of C++ programming, from basic syntax and memory management to complex concepts such as polymorphism, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL). The goal of the project is to solidify a deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ while adhering to the C++98 standard.
